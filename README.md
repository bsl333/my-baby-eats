# my-baby-eats
Q1 Project for Galvanize - monitoring an infant's food intake as well as their behavior throughout the day, then dynamically plotting information in real-time. 

To get started, fork project

### Install dependencies
`npm install`

### To build development environment
`npm run build` - will build bundle.js via browserify

`npm run dev` - will start watchify to rebuild bundle.js if any files are changed.

If everything worked successfully, should load a new tab in localhost:8080 with application running.
